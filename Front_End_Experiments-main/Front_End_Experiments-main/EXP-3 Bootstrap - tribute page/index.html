        <h3>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h3>
        <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, 
            India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of 
            India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007. As president, Kalam promoted the 
            advancement of the national nuclear weapons program.Kalam also devised a 20-year action plan to achieve economic 
            growth through technological development in India.</p>
        <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam attended the Madras Institute of Technology, where he received a degree in aeronautical engineering
             in 1960. After graduation he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)—an Indian military 
             research institute—and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam’s associations were not limited 
             to research organizations: he was also associated with political groups, such as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).</p>
        <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam created the Technology Vision 2020 project in 1998. The project sought to develop India’s economy 
            through technology, particularly as applied to agriculture, and increase the availability of health care and education. 
            In recognition of Kalam’s services to the country and broad popularity, the National Democratic Alliance nominated him
             for president in 2002.</p>
        <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam won many awards, both from the Indian government and from the international community. His most 
            notable awards were the Padma Vibhushan, won in 1990, and the Bharat Ratna, won in 1997, for his contributions to 
            science and engineering and service to the government.</p>
